# Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles 

Amazon's Leadership Principles are the core values that guide its employees in every decision and action. These principles define the company's culture and set the standard for how Amazon operates.


### 1. :shopping_cart: Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work to earn and keep customer trust.


### 2. :key: Ownership
Leaders act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They think long term and never sacrifice long-term value for short-term results.


### 3. :bulb: Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, looking for new ideas from everywhere.


### 4. :dart: Are Right, A Lot
Leaders have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.


### 5. :books: Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.


### 6. :raised_hands: Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders hire and mentor the best people. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization.


### 7. :bar_chart: Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders continually raise the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes. They ensure that defects do not get sent down the line.


### 8. :rocket: Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results.


### 9. :zap: Bias for Action
Leaders value calculated risk-taking. Speed matters in business, and many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study.


### 10. :moneybag: Frugality
Leaders accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention.


### 11. :handshake: Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.


### 12. :mag: Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, and audit frequently. No task is beneath them.


### 13. :muscle: Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.


### 14. :trophy: Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.


### 15. :earth_americas: Strive to Be Earth's Best Employer
Leaders work to create a safer, more productive, higher-performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy and have fun at work.


### 16. :globe_with_meridians: Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility
Leaders are determined to make better, do better, and be better for the company’s employees, customers, partners, and the world.

Here are some sample problems that resemble the types of scenarios you might encounter in Amazon’s Work Simulation online assessment:

## Samples 
### Scenario 1: Prioritization and Time Management
**Scenario**: You have a list of tasks to complete by the end of the day:
1. Prepare a report for a meeting scheduled tomorrow.
2. Respond to an urgent customer inquiry.
3. Review a colleague's work on a project due at the end of the week.
4. Attend a team meeting in an hour.
  
**Question**: How would you prioritize these tasks?
- **A.** Respond to the customer inquiry first, then prepare the report, attend the meeting, and review the colleague’s work last.
- **B.** Prepare the report first, then review the colleague’s work, respond to the customer inquiry, and attend the meeting last.
- **C.** Attend the team meeting first, then respond to the customer inquiry, prepare the report, and review the colleague’s work last.
- **D.** Review the colleague’s work first, attend the team meeting, respond to the customer inquiry, and prepare the report last.

**Explanation**: 
- The best approach would likely prioritize the urgent customer inquiry (to maintain customer satisfaction, a key Amazon value), then prepare for the meeting tomorrow, attend the scheduled team meeting, and review the colleague’s work afterward. Therefore, **A** might be the most appropriate choice.

### Scenario 2: Customer Obsession
**Scenario**: A customer has placed an order, but the item is out of stock. The item will be back in stock in a week, but the customer needs it within three days.

**Question**: What would you do?
- **A.** Apologize to the customer and offer them a discount on their next purchase.
- **B.** Offer to cancel the order and suggest an alternative product that is in stock.
- **C.** Inform the customer that the item will be back in stock in a week and ask if they are willing to wait.
- **D.** Expedite the shipping as soon as the item is back in stock and offer to cover the expedited shipping cost.

**Explanation**:
- The best response aligns with Amazon’s customer obsession principle. You would likely want to keep the customer satisfied by offering an immediate solution, such as suggesting an alternative product or covering expedited shipping. **B** might be the best answer, as it provides an immediate option while still considering the customer’s needs.

### Scenario 3: Dealing with Ambiguity
**Scenario**: You receive an email from a colleague asking for your help with a project. The email is vague and doesn’t provide much detail about what they need.

**Question**: How do you respond?
- **A.** Reply and ask for more details about what they need help with.
- **B.** Assume they need help with something urgent and start working on it immediately.
- **C.** Ignore the email until your colleague follows up with more information.
- **D.** Forward the email to your manager to ask for advice.

**Explanation**:
- Dealing with ambiguity often requires seeking clarity to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, **A** would likely be the best response, as it demonstrates initiative while ensuring that you understand the request fully before acting.

### Scenario 4: Leadership and Teamwork
**Scenario**: Your team is working on a project with a tight deadline. One of your team members is struggling with their portion, which is affecting the overall progress.

**Question**: What would you do?
- **A.** Offer to help your teammate with their portion of the work.
- **B.** Discuss the issue with your manager and ask for their advice.
- **C.** Ask the team member to work overtime to complete their portion.
- **D.** Focus on your own tasks to ensure they are completed on time.

**Explanation**:
- Amazon values teamwork and leadership, so **A** would likely be the best choice. Offering to help your teammate not only improves the chances of meeting the deadline but also fosters collaboration and a positive work environment.

These are just examples, but the key to doing well in these scenarios is to align your responses with Amazon's core principles, especially customer obsession, ownership, and bias for action.
